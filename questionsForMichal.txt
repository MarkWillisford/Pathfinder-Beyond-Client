series of "expandable card" loops, easily in the hundreds probably more. I don't need them in memory until I select them. Do I really need to put them in the store?

details page => fields of the form in children components?
dice page => can't connect to state
		so close!  if there are two 16s available and one is selected, then both are removed from the array
		


If I Have Time:
Extrapulate the traits onto cards

AbilityScoreDice: OnSubmit seems to be called early. 
Add or remove the extra ability score generation
clean up details

1.) little quality of life things, like moving the view screen to ensure an expanded area is viewable. 
Redux forms, passable warnings . . .    "are you sure you want to leave xyz blank?"

3.) can I require or import functions into the reducer and call them to act on the data coming in?
	Yes
4.) can I import a full table from the state vs each individual cell?
	Yes
2.) watching values in state and dispatching actions when they change
	get _xyz(){}
