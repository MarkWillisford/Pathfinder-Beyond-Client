The internal API has a number of endpoints that simply return the various data collections that the app needs; from lists of classes available to the player to the gear choices. In addition, the API also is responsible for User registration, verification, and authentication using Passport and JWTs

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
